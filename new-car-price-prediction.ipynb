Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:\n\n- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car\n- How well those variables describe the price of a car\n\nBased on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Americal market.\n\n**Business Goal**\n\nWe are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, themodel will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Project Objective :\n* Based on the data and data dictionary, We have prediction / regression problem.\n* We wil make prediction on the target variable `PRICE`\n* And we will build a model to get best prediction on the price variable.
